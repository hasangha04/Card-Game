# Card Game
This is a card game made using the stack data structure. The game is played by asking the user what they would like to do after the cards are shown. 
After the user is done receiving cards the dealer will receive their cards using a simple while loop with if conditions to make sure the dealer gets the 
correct amount of cards. Then the game checks who has a total closer to 21 and then declares the winner.
